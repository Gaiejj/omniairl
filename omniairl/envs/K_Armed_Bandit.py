    """K-armed bandit environment.

    The agent has to choose one of K arms to pull at each timestep.
    The reward is randomly drawn from a normal distribution
    with mean `q_star[a]` and standard deviation `reward_std`,
    where `q_star` is the true mean reward for arm `a`.
    The goal is to learn to select the arm that yields the highest expected reward.

    Args:
        num_arms: An integer specifying the number of arms in the bandit.
        max_steps: An integer specifying the maximum number of timesteps for an episode.
        reward_mean: A float specifying the mean of the true reward distribution for each arm.
        reward_std: A float specifying the standard deviation of the true reward distribution for each arm.

    Attributes:
        action_space: A numpy array containing the available actions (i.e., the arms).
        num_arms: An integer specifying the number of arms in the bandit.
        max_steps: An integer specifying the maximum number of timesteps for an episode.

        q_star: A numpy array containing the true mean rewards for each arm.
        timestep: An integer specifying the current timestep.
